As for my quick intoroduction, 
I have passed out from M.Sc. I.T. in 2019 and after that I continouosly learned new skills while doing part time computer repair so that experience is also a plus and after completing Data Science Specialization course from internshala 
I have confidence on my problem solving and critical thinking skills which are really mendatory to be a successful data analyst/scientist. 

I hope we will look forward to work together.
